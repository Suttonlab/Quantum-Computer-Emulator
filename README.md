# Quantum-Computer-Emulator
This is a Quantum Circuit Computer capable of creating and applying algorithms to quantum circuits, without the use of QC libraries.
Use main.ipynb for direct access to the algorithms Grover's and Shor's. Some examples are given there. To build a new algorithm, create a new library, and construct registers and gates as described in their libraries. See G/S for samples.
